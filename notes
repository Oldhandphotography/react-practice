2 variables declared in the function body.
3 state can be changed.
4 useState hook - functional Components
this.state- class component


asynchronus and synchronus
asynchronus call:
if we crement a function and call setstate 5 times it will not increment the state to 5 because it will not evaluate the result after every setstate called 

synchronus:
but if we try to do this task with defining previous state and call the function like console.log with it it will increment the state after every time the state called like 5 10 15..... which is a synchronus call.

code has to be executed after the state has been updated? place that code in that code in the call back function which is the second argumnet to the setstate method.

when you have to update state based on the previous sate value , pass in a function as an argument instead o fthe regular object.
